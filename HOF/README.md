- Higher order function can accept other functions transported as variables...
- all functional programming languages is the ability to take a function and pass it as a parameter to another function. this binds that funtion parameter to a variable, which can be used as another vairiable within the function. A function that can accept other functions transported around as variables are called higher order functions. 
-Shadowing is the term used to describe the act of defining a new variable that has the same name as one that was in the parent scope. This warning is there to prevent some mistakes.
-Closure is having a function that referenes some environment along with it (value's part of the scope).
